## Seattle Tile Map Collection

This repo contains four different tile sets built with Mapbox, QGIS, and QMetaTiles. All four tile sets focus on Seattle, Washington, and were exported at zoom levels 10–14.

### Screenshots of the Four Tile Layers

#### 1. Custom Basemap

A simple basemap edited from Mapbox Dark style. I changed the water color and adjusted some label styles.
